# Public Sentiment Voting

## Overview

The **Public Sentiment Voting** project is designed to influence decisions based on real-time public sentiment analysis. By leveraging sentiment analysis, the project enables users to vote on various topics or proposals, and their votes are weighted according to the sentiment of the public on these topics. This allows for more democratic decision-making, with outcomes driven by the collective mood and opinion of the community.

## Features

- **Public Sentiment Analysis**: The system analyzes the public's sentiment around a particular topic or proposal, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Influence on Voting**: The sentiment score directly influences the weight of each vote, giving more power to users who align with the prevailing sentiment.
- **Transparency**: All sentiment data and voting results are publicly accessible, providing transparency and trust in the voting process.
- **Blockchain-based**: The project is deployed on the **Edu Chain**, ensuring that all transactions and votes are immutable and securely stored on the blockchain.
  
## Deployed Contract Address

The smart contract for this project is deployed at the following address on **Edu Chain**:

### 0xe12136f7ef0587a09f700629cFD1aB0518eDe714

You can interact with the contract using this address to:

- View sentiment data on various topics
- Cast votes that are influenced by public sentiment
- Query voting results
- Moreâ€¦

## How It Works

1. **Vote Submission**: Users submit their votes through the smart contract interface.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment data related to the vote topic is collected from the public.
3. **Vote Weighting**: The sentiment score is factored into the weight of each vote cast.
4. **Outcome**: The final decision is influenced by the weighted votes, giving more importance to those who align with the majority sentiment.

## How to Use
